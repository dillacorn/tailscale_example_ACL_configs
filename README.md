# tailscale_example_ACL_configs
[Tailscale](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale) is a VPN for your home server which allows you access your self hosted applications and gives you the ability to easily share with friends! This repository is for example ACL configurations to help you get a feel allowing and not-allowing specific accounts specific port access from your server.

I also provide these same configs here: https://github.com/dillacorn/win-glaze-dots/tree/main/ScreenShots_For_Guides/Tailscale_notes
